Decentralized identities and why they are important in africa.

What are decentralized identities?

Authorities, and government parastatals need for control gave birth to centralized identities. Over the years, they have evolved from simple records to more sophisticated systems managed by the government and other corporations. However, centralized systems are usually subject to regulatory and jurisdictional issues. Their central point of gathering user information makes it vulnerable to attacks and there are also a lot of restrictions and limitations. 
The concept of decentralizing this system gives users sovereignty, better security, and generally just stands as an ideal solution to combating the bottlenecks of centralized systems.

Decentralized identities, also known as self sovereign identities are a way for people to take control of their identity, without the reliance of external bodies to manage it for them<sup>1</sup> . They are hosted on protocols that are difficult to shut down. Furthermore, decentralized identities only share information with entities when they consent to.

Why are decentralized identities important?

The use cases for decentralized identities are innumerable. From giving users access control/ownership to their data, to enabling universal login credentials to avoid different usernames and passwords across applications and devices, to massively reducing the risk of getting scammed online etc. The autonomy it gives to users gives them the luxury of choosing how and where their data goes to. 
Decentralized identities play a crucial role in the aspect of reinforcing trust and good reputation online. These systems allow participants to access the credibility and reliability of others. One way this is being implemented is through the integration of tokenized reputation. Through blockchain based tokens, participants in a network earn reputation points based on their contributions and behaviors within a given network<sup>2</sup> .

Relevance in the african context

There are lingering concerns about the feasibility of inter-institutional collaborations when the government ministries are fragmented. Public institutions in many African countries are still encumbered with complex internal political dynamics. This might result in national ID’s being exploited for political purposes especially in non-democratic systems in africa<sup>3</sup> . 
The need for user data security and privacy protection can not be overstated especially where trust for the government is very low. Interoperability also becomes difficult because of system designs and technology choices. 
For example, we look at the Philippines' successful implementation with mosip, an open source solution that efficiently manages registration and identity management. This contrasts with Uganda's vendor locked system, which has hampered scalability and concurrency. 
DIDs in Africa are eliminating these challenges and giving better protection from regularizations that pose threats to users by giving them sovereignty over their identities.
Ownership encourages innovation which will eventually improve economic growth and financial inclusion in Africa.
Decentralized identities can play very important roles in combating rampant fraud in Africa by decentralized verification. The distributed nature of blockchain makes it extremely difficult for deep fakes or synthetic identities to infiltrate the system and scale across multiple verification points.
This technology can also greatly enable refugees in Africa as it enables protection and gives them better control of their ID<sup>4</sup> , providing a digital verification mechanism for people unable to prove their identity and allowing them to share their identity and transact with other actors,

What regulatory frameworks are necessary to govern the use of DIDs in Africa?

The role of government in the advancement of DIDs will require them to not just be regulators, but also leaders. They have the unique responsibility to establish an ethical framework that balances the benefits of technology with the protection of citizens rights.
DID presents a unique opportunity for the government to redefine and strengthen their role, not only as regulators but also as innovators and protectors of public welfare. 
The government must develop and enact policies that clearly define standards for security, privacy and accessibility. This includes ensuring interoperability between different platforms and services. 
These policies must protect human rights, enforcing that personal information is handled ethically and transparency. The challenge here is balancing security with privacy. They have to ensure that the technologies are robust enough to protect against fraud and cyber attacks, while ensuring that individual privacy remains inviolable.
It is also imperative that DIDs are not used to further exclude marginalized communities. DIDs should be designed in a way to enable individuals from all backgrounds to participate. This means confronting language and technological barriers and the digital divide. 

Why is interoperability important?

Interoperability is the fundamental key in scaling DIDs. The current challenge at the moment is figuring out which solutions to interoperate with each other. Interoperability reduces friction for users, they can interact smoothly with different entities without worrying about the underlying technologies<sup>5</sup> . It also opens up new business opportunities as new projects could be built on top of an existing network.

Real-world examples of DIDs in Africa.

Africa is slowly seeing a surge in blockchain projects with core objectives of revamping its digital identity infrastructure. For example, Trustlab, a South-african based startup formed an alliance with UN’s international organizations for migration to enforce refugee personal data protection while simultaneously establishing their identity. There are other examples like Sovrin and flexID which spotlights the potential of blockchain technology in addressing the digital identity challenges rampant across africa.


Conclusion.

DIDs could be very pivotal in handing access control to individuals in africa. It could foster trust among entities online, and ease out verification issues when it comes to transactions. The nature of the distributed system astronomically reduces the risk of online fraud and encourages good reputation online. Refugees and internally displaced persons will have the luxury of having ownership over their data and only consent to who they want to give it to. The government and international organizations should not only set policies and regulations, but also lead the initiative towards a more decentralized system especially in identity management in African societies.
